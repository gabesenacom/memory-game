            <p>
              The goal of Creature Clash is to move your ranger past every single
              other player's ranger, stealing a life from each one as you go by
              them. The first player to collect all of the lives wins.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game is played in turns, with players attempting to move their
              rangers down the pathway. On a player's turn, they look at the
              image on the next tile in front of their ranger. The player then
              flips over one of the face-down tiles. If the tile that was
              flipped over shows the same image as the next tile in front of the
              ranger, the player moves forward one space on to that tile, and
              then repeats the process with the next tile. When the player flips
              over a tile with an image that does not match the next tile in
              front of their ranger, their turn ends and their ranger goes no
              farther.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone
              else's ranger, and the player succeeds in matching that tile,
              their ranger "leapfrogs" over the ranger in front of them to land
              on the next tile in front of that player, and in the process
              steals all lives that the other ranger had - including those it
              stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has
              all of the lives, that player wins the game.
